With support from Dr. Scheerer I managed to write a lean, impressive and well structured CV that points out my professional achievements instead of boringly listing my skills. After all, a yield of 1 successful application within 5 trials speaks for itself. Thanks again.

Job searching is exhausting, no question about it. To even advance to the next round in the application process, everything simply has to be perfect. This means not only showing creativity and simultaneously having a sense of nuance for a meaningful, but not exaggerated application, but also presenting yourself in the best possible way overall.

The resume makes the first impression, that's well known to everyone. But the fact that the work invested in each application also repeatedly means revisiting the resume - that's something many people underestimate.

Adrian took the time to extensively discuss and revise my resume with me. This meant not only formulating my career path comprehensively without gaps, but creating a coherent overall picture - from text, application photo, layout, and meaningful vocabulary.

The rate of invitations to job interviews doubled with the new, improved resume. Before, it took about ten applications to get one interview; afterward, only five.

And almost more importantly - my motivation increased again as well. The newly appreciated way of presenting myself also helped me in the interviews. I set targeted priorities and was rewarded after only a short time with a good job - not exactly easy as a career starter right after university.

That was about 5 months ago. During this time, it wasn't uncommon for friends to ask if I would share my resume as a template - since it really looked very appealing. Gladly - thanks to Adrian.

In school, I wrote my first CV, and since then used it with a few updates on every application for employment. For my last application, which was much more important for me personally, Adrian Scheerer helped me restructure my CV to make it more appealing to myself and my potential new employers. His precise and goal oriented tips were easy to follow and I new I could trust him because of his experience in writing CVs. Ultimately his help proved to be very useful since the feedback I got myself was very positive.
